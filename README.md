# Market Research & Use Case Generation Agent

An intelligent multi-agent system that performs market research and generates actionable AI/ML and Generative AI use cases, complete with dataset links and solution proposals â€” all based on a simple input: a company or industry.

---

## Overview

This project leverages a multi-agent architecture to:

- Research a company or industry using real-time search and LLMs.
- Generate relevant, practical use cases for AI, ML, and GenAI adoption.
- Find public datasets (from Kaggle, HuggingFace, etc.) aligned with those use cases.
- Suggest GenAI tools and workflows that can be applied internally or externally.
- Present everything in a clean interface via **Streamlit**.
